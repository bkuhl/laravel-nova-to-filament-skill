# laravel-nova-to-filament-skill

A Claude AI skill (system prompt) that guides an AI coding agent through a **complete, production-quality migration from Laravel Nova to Filament PHP v5**.

## Installation

```bash
claude skill install github:bkuhl/laravel-nova-to-filament-skill
```

## Purpose

Migrating an admin panel from Laravel Nova to Filament PHP is a non-trivial undertaking.  
Resources, fields, actions, filters, lenses, metrics, dashboards, custom tools, and authorization rules all need to be understood and translated — some map 1:1, others require a plugin, and a few require a fundamentally different architectural approach.

This skill gives a Claude agent the detailed knowledge it needs to:

1. **Audit** an existing Nova application and produce a structured inventory of every artifact (resources, actions, filters, lenses, metrics, dashboards, custom tools, policies).
2. **Classify** each artifact by migration complexity (direct mapping, plugin, or custom Livewire work) and identify any non-standard components that need clarification from the developer before migration can proceed.
3. **Plan** the migration in dependency order, while running Filament at a separate URL path (`/filament`) so Nova stays live and the developer can compare both panels side-by-side throughout the process.
4. **Execute** the migration phase by phase — resources, actions, filters, lenses, metrics, dashboards, custom tools, authorization, and navigation — using idiomatic Filament v5 patterns.
5. **Verify** the migration with a per-resource acceptance checklist, Filament test helpers, and a side-by-side browser comparison workflow.
6. **Cut over** cleanly by switching paths, removing Nova, and redirecting the old URL.

## What the skill covers

| Topic | Detail |
|---|---|
| **Field mapping** | Every Nova field class mapped to its Filament equivalent (form + table), including edge cases like `MorphTo`, `Stack`, `resolveUsing`, `displayUsing`, `fillUsing`, and conditional visibility via `dependsOn` / `->live()` |
| **Resource settings** | `$title`, `$search`, `$group`, `$icon`, `$priority`, `$label`, `$perPageOptions`, `$clickAction`, `$polling` |
| **Form layout** | Nova `Panel` → Filament `Section` / `Tabs` / `Wizard` / `Grid` / `Fieldset` / `Split` |
| **Relationships** | `BelongsTo`, `BelongsToMany`, `HasMany`, `HasOne`, `MorphMany`, `MorphTo` → `Select`, `RelationManager` |
| **Actions** | Basic, destructive, queued, confirmation modal, action form fields, file downloads, bulk actions, header actions |
| **Filters** | `SelectFilter`, `TernaryFilter`, custom date-range filters |
| **Lenses** | Converted to custom Filament pages with embedded `InteractsWithTable` |
| **Metrics** | `Value` → `StatsOverviewWidget`, `Trend` → `ChartWidget` (line), `Partition` → `ChartWidget` (doughnut) |
| **Dashboards** | Nova dashboard pages → Filament Dashboard with registered widgets |
| **Custom tools** | Decision tree: data viz → widgets, form workflow → wizard, JS-heavy → Livewire page or iframe |
| **Authorization** | Policy method mapping, field-level `->visible()`, action `->authorize()`, resource `canCreate/canEdit/canDelete`, spatie-permission plugin |
| **Navigation** | `$group`, `$priority`, `$icon`, `Nova::mainMenu()` → `navigationItems`, `Nova::userMenu()` → `userMenuItems` |
| **Notifications** | Flash → `Notification::make()->send()`, persistent → `sendToDatabase()` |
| **Testing** | Filament Livewire test helpers, side-by-side acceptance checklist |
| **Plugins** | Curated table of community plugins for capabilities without a built-in Filament equivalent |
| **Artisan commands** | Nova vs Filament command reference |
